// English Pokémon TCG sets whose sealed product DexCompare groups by set.
// Newest first. Derived from the pokemontcg.io set catalogue the old DexCompare
// shipped (XY onward), minus the sub-sets that never have sealed product of
// their own (trainer/galarian galleries, shiny vaults, promos, McDonald's).
//
// ADDING A SET: add an entry at the top. `slug` is the URL (/au/sets/<slug>)
// and must never change once live. If a store titles the set some other way,
// add an `aliases` regex source. Nothing else needs editing — products group
// under the new set on the next import.
//
// `generic` marks a set whose name is also its SERIES name ("Scarlet &
// Violet", "Mega Evolution"). Stores prefix every set in a series with it
// ("Scarlet & Violet—Surging Sparks Elite Trainer Box"), so a generic set only
// matches when no other set does. See detectSet() in sealed-title.ts.
