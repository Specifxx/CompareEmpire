// The Black Friday / Cyber Monday PRICE WATCH (DECISIONS.md, 2026-11-06). The owner's October numbers: the US made 73% of
// affiliate earnings at a US$108 average order, one US$6.4k order earned as much as twelve ordinary days, and eBay credits only a
// purchase made within 24 hours of the click. So /<region>/black-friday and /<region>/cyber-monday carry, under the deals, the
// high-value end of the market with an eBay search beside every row (the live listing strips stay what they are everywhere: client
// fetched, never in the server HTML, components/EbayStrip.tsx): the dearest sealed in stock, the week's moves down (lib/stock.ts
// priceMoves), older sets still in stock (lib/stock.ts groupOlderInStock, one product per set) and graded chase-card searches.
// The copy stays inside lib/copy-rules.ts: never "price drops", "dropped", a "was" price or a countdown.
