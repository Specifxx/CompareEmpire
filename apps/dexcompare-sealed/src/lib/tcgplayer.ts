// TCGplayer: the US marketplace, read as one more US source beside the stores.
//
// Data comes from TCGplayer's public search API — the endpoint its own website
// searches with, no credentials (the same client Rift Compare runs, see
// src/lib/tcgplayer.ts there). One query returns the whole English Pokémon
// sealed catalogue, ~2,940 products, 50 per page (the API's maximum: 51 is a
// 400). Each product carries a preview of its cheapest listings, filtered at
// the source (searchBody) to live, standard, English, in-stock listings.
//
// What a TCGplayer offer is (the data contract with the UI, src/lib/stores.ts):
// an ordinary Offer row, store "tcgplayer", market US, url the canonical
// /product/<id>/<slug> page (never an affiliate link: links are tagged at
// render time), price the cheapest such listing's ITEM price in US cents,
// excluding shipping like every store price. A product with no such listing is
// not written at all: TCGplayer has no "sold out", only no sellers.
//
// Facts the code below relies on, checked against the live API on 2026-09-27:
//   - Pagination needs a unique sort. The default relevance order shifts
//     between requests: paging through it returned 2,694 distinct products of
//     2,936, the rest as repeats. Sorted by product id, every product once.
//   - The listing preview is at most THREE listings, ordered by price +
//     shipping; `listingSearch` accepts no size or sort. Asking for more means
//     one request per product (/v1/product/<id>/listings), ~2,300 more a run,
//     so the cheapest item price is taken from those three.
//   - `lowestPrice` is NOT filtered by listingSearch (it counts custom and
//     other-language listings: $1.00 for a Perfect Order ETB), and
//     `totalListings` can be stale (19 on a product whose listings endpoint
//     says 0). Neither is used. No preview listing = no seller.
//   - "custom" listings (a seller's own photos and description) include
//     partial items, like a $5.99 "coin & dice" listed under an ETB, so only
//     "standard" ones count.
//   - Some sellers load the price into shipping: a Chaos Rising ETB at $50.00
//     + $199.99 shipping, a UPC at $375.01 + $199.99 beside $575 + free
//     shipping. Such a listing's item price is not a price anyone pays, so it
//     is skipped (shippingLoaded).
//   - Some products' only sellers ask a placeholder: a Team Plasma Tin at
//     $19,999.99 against a $1,000 market price, Base Set 2 theme decks at
//     $1,000. A listing over three times TCGplayer's own market price for the
//     product is skipped (15 products of ~2,250 on the day). Most older
//     products have NO market price (11 of the 18 with listings on page 0),
//     so the importer also drops asks far above the stores' asks or the set's
//     single unit (dropPlaceholderAsks in importer.ts).
